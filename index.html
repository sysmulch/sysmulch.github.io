<img src="images/ravi.jpg" alt="Ravi's photo" style="max-width:25%; margin-right: 10px;">

<p>I am a technical communicator, broadly speaking.</p>

<p>I've led writing workshops for researchers in many countries, and I've developed online courses for a global audience. With my background in engineering, I'm a bit of a nerd as well.</p>

<p>I expect to become a U.S. permanent resident in September 2024, and I am open to contract opportunities. Check out my work samples below. And here's <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ravimurugesan/">my LinkedIn profile</a>.

<p>These samples are in descending chronological order.</p>

<h3>Installing eScriptorium on a Cloud Server (2024)</h3>
<em>An installation guide</em>

<p>My wife, who is a librarian, wanted to explore eScriptorium, an application for handwritten text recognition. I found various installation instructions, but none of them were aimed at the goal I had in mind: setting up an eScriptorium site on a small, cheap cloud server. I got in touch with one of the project developers, and with his help I managed to get the site online. In return, I wrote an installation guide and added it to one of the project wikis.</p>

<h3>The Other and the Pastoral Ideal (2023)</h3>
<em>An essay for a literature course</em>

<p>This piece isn't part of my professional work. But it is work in a different sense: a personal quest to understand America as an immigrant-in-waiting. As part of this quest, I took a course on the modern American novel with Oxford University's continuing education department. I read and discussed five novels during the course, and at the end I submitted an essay titled "The Other and the Pastoral Ideal: A Common Thread in <em>Ceremony</em> and <em>American Pastoral</em>." Of course, this isn't a TechComm piece &mdash; it is simply a writing sample I am proud of.</p>

<h3>Ten Tips for Research Scholars Aiming for Their First Significant Publication (2023)</h3>
<em>A primer</em>

<p>In 2023, after many years of teaching scientific writing, I was inspired to write a practical guide to focus on a crucial stage of an aspiring researcher's journey: their first significant publication in a scholarly journal. As far as I know, there is no practical guide that looks at scientific writing from this particular angle. I published this guide in Science Editor, a journal that is widely read in the scientific publishing community in the United States and elsewhere.</p>

<h3>
    Welcome Video for Participants in INASP's Facilitated Courses (2023)
</h3>

<em>A video for online course participants</em>

<p>I wear various hats to support the online learning initiative at INASP, a nonprofit in the U.K. Since 2011, I have been a site administrator, instructional designer, content writer, course developer, course facilitator, and general online learning nerd. I recently collaborated with one of our guest facilitators to record an onboarding video for course participants, many of whom don't have experience using a learning management system.</p>

<h3>Digital Technology in Capacity Development (2022)</h3>
<em>Chapters in a book</em>

<p>In 2022, I worked with my colleagues at INASP to write a book on how digital tools and platforms can be used for capacity development in the Global South. The open access book was published by African Minds, a publisher in South Africa. I co-authored two of the four chapters in the book and several case studies.</p>

<h3>Lessons Learned in Setting Up a Lean Institutional Repository (2021)</h3>
<em>A conference talk</em>

<p>While living in Auroville, an international township in South India, I volunteered as a report writer and system administrator. I installed and maintained an institutional repository on a shoestring budget, and I gave a talk about my work at Open Repositories 2021.</p>

<h3>A MOOC Approach for Training Researchers in Developing Countries (2017)</h3>
<em>A research article</em>

<p>In 2015, I led the introduction of MOOCs at INASP, responding to the surging demand for training on scientific writing from researchers in the Global South. In 2017, after seeing successful outcomes, I authored a research article about our experience. This article has received more than 50 scholarly citations since then, demonstrating its impact on MOOC practice and research.</p>

<h3>How to Target a Journal That's Right for Your Research (2014)</h3>
<em>A practical guide</em>

<p>In 2014, after speaking at a USAID conference for researchers in Tanzania, I was invited by SciDev.Net to write an article on how researchers should select a target journal. SciDev.Net is a well-known news source in the science and development sector. The article I wrote was one of the most highly read articles on the website for a few weeks after publication.</p>
